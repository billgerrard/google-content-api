Revision history for Google::ContentAPI.

1.02  2018-04-11 Added accountstatuses and productstatuses methods. Also added 
                 a "custom" resource to perform methods that are not implemented 
                 by this module.

1.01  2018-03-27 Added config_json, merchant_id options.
                 Switched to Crypt::JWT on recommendation of Andrew Maltsev, as
                 it is a more stable module and is likely to be installed already.
